**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

The Farmers Market Database schema, while well-designed, has significant scope for improvement regarding ethical considerations and data security.
Sensitive information, such as customer names, postal codes, and transaction details, poses risks of exploitation if not adequately protected. Similarly, vendor pricing and inventory information could jeopardize competitive integrity and sustainability practices.

Upon auditing the data, there are concerns regarding data security, privacy, leaks. A malicious entity can exploit this data, and can cause harm to the business, as well as the customers.
Various metrics can be generated from the data, that can highlight spending by demographics, based on the postal code, which can lead to biases, such as promotions, flyers, offers tailored to specific postal codes. High and Low income communities can be identified and marginalized.

Vendor's pricing is also very sensitive information, if leaked this can cause other vendors to compromise on quality and environmental sustainability.

To address these concerns, a thorough data security audit should be conducted to identify vulnerabilities. Role-based access control will limit data access to authorized personnel based on their job requirements, data encryption for sensitive fields will safeguard against unauthorized access. Data obfuscation techniques will protect customer and vendor information for technical staff, ensuring they can perform necessary tasks without exposure to sensitive data.

Training sessions on data privacy and ethics need to be conducted for staff. Establishing ethical marketing guidelines will ensure that demographic data is used responsibly, promoting inclusivity and preventing biases in promotions. By adopting these measures, the database can enhance its ethical integrity and security, ultimately protecting both customers and vendors.
